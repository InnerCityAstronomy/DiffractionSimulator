# Diffraction Simulator
This program simulates diffraction pattern generated by a focusing mask or secondary mirror obstruction in telescopes. The solution is obtained by finding the [Fraunhofer diffraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraunhofer_diffraction) pattern for a given aperture, which can be computed for multichromatic light. The effect of incorrect focus can also be included, allowing the performance of focusing masks such as Bahtinov masks to be simulated.

A full guide on how to use it can be found [here](https://innercityastronomy.com/diffraction-simulator/).
